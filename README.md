  The User is prompted to first enter a location type to search, and a city in which to search for these locations. Once the request is completed 
  through the Google Maps API, the information is then displayed on a map using Maps JS. The Find My Rating app creates markers for each matching business found,
  and will display the current weather of the city selected using the OpenWeatherMap API.
